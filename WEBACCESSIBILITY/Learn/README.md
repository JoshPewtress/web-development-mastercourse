# Notes

## Semantic HTML
-  When designing a webpage for accessibility it is important to use the correct structure tags. Screen readers are unable to understand that making text clickable with a `span` makes it a link even though we style the `span` as if it was an `anchor` tag. Always use the correct tag for the purpose of what you are trying to achieve. HTML is about structure, not style.
