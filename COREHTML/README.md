# COREHTML — HTML Learning & Practice

This folder contains everything I've learned while studying HTML through the *Web Development Mastercourse* by Tim Corey.  
It is divided into two parts:

- **Learn** - simple pages built exactly as demonstrated in the course  
- **Practice** - my own expanding project where I apply every new concept I learn

## Learn — Following the Course

The **Learn** folder contains a very simple website created step-by-step while following the lessons.  
It includes:

- Basic HTML structure  
- Lists  
- Links and navigation  
- Images with alt text  
- Multi-page navigation  
- Simple forms (inputs, labels, radio buttons, checkboxes)  
- Tables with proper semantic tags  

This section mirrors exactly what the instructor teaches, which helps reinforce the fundamentals without distractions.

## Practice — My Evolving HTML Project

The **Practice** folder is where the real growth happens.

This is a project I update **every time I learn something new**.  
Even small concepts (like indentation, ARIA, or table scopes) are integrated somewhere in the project.

### Why This Folder Matters

- It evolves alongside my skills  
- Every improvement shows visible progress  
- It forces me to **apply** concepts instead of just reading them  
- It helps me build real-world pages, not just isolated examples  
- It serves as a portfolio-quality foundation I can refine over time  

### What the Practice Site Includes (So Far)

- Semantic HTML structure  
- Navigation and multi-page site layout  
- Images wrapped in `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`  
- Topic sections with headers + icons  
- Tables with accessibility attributes  
- ARIA attributes  
- External CSS  
- External JavaScript  
- Custom fonts  
- Forms with validation  
- A learning plan table  
- A "Hire Me" form page  
- A continually growing list of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript topics I’ve learned

## Purpose of This Folder

This folder isn't just homework, it's a **living demonstration** of my capabilities.

As I continue learning:

- New lessons become new features  
- Better techniques replace older ones  
- Structure and design gets refined  
- The project becomes more polished, functional, and maintainable  

By the end of the course, this folder will serve as a **complete showcase of my mastery over HTML fundamentals**, and a strong foundation to build my CSS and JavaScript skills upon.

- **HTML5** (semantic structure, accessibility, forms, tables, media)
- **CSS3** (external stylesheet, fonts, layout, styling)

## Final Thoughts

The COREHTML folder represents the beginning of my web development journey.  
Everything here, even the earliest “ugly” pages, shows progress.

The **Practice** project is something I'm genuinely proud of, and it will keep growing with every lesson.
