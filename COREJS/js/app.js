Best Practices

1. Add 'use strict'; to the top of every file and IIFE
2. Do not use var - use let or const instead. Prefer const
3. Naming - use camelCase for variables, functions, etc. and PascalCase for classes
4. Use IIFE's whenever it makes sense - it almost always makes sense
5. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should
6. Use a separate file for your JavaScript
7. Use semi-colons
8. Don't assume
