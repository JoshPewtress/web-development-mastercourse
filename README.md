# Web Development Mastercourse — Study Notes

This repository contains my organized notes and example code as I learn web development through the *Web Development Mastercourse* on [IAmTimCorey.com](https://www.iamtimcorey.com/).  
It’s a personal study reference — everything from HTML basics to CSS, layout, and JavaScript fundamentals.

---

## Overview

- **Purpose:** A single place to track and reference what I've learned about HTML, CSS, and JS. From beginner topics to more advanced patterns.  
- **Structure:** Divided into folders (`COREHTML`, `CORECSS`, `COREJS`, `WEBACCESSIBILITY`, etc.), each containing a `README.md` that documents key concepts, examples, best practices, and my personal notes.  
- **Who it's for:** Me (my future self), but you’re welcome to browse if you're learning along too.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repo locally:  
   ```bash

   ```
2. Browse through the folders (`COREHTML`, `CORECSS`, `COREJS`, `WEBACCESSIBILITY`, ...).
3. Open the relevant `README.md` to review concepts or sample code.
4. Use examples directly in your own projects, copy/paste, tweak, experiment!

## What's Inside Each Section

Each folder contains:

- Clear explanations of relevant concepts
- Example code for quick reference
- Best practice notes
- Step-by-step progression aligned with the Mastercourse

This structure makes it easy to revisit concepts as projects become more complex.

## Status & Progress

| Section | Topics Covered |
| :----- | :------ |
| COREHTML | Tags, structure, debugging, page setup |
| CORECSS | Selectors, sizing, fonts, colors, spacing, float, specificity |
| COREJS | Script tag, console output, variables, arrays, conditionals, loops, functions, objects |
| WEBACCESSIBILITY | Semantic HTML, ARIA-labels |

I update these sections as I learn new material and apply it in practice projects.

## Learning Goals & Motivation

I'm using this repository to:

- Show my learning journey with web development
- Build a reusable **reference library** of web development fundamentals
- Reinforce learning through hands-on examples and written summaries
- Practice professional documentation habits
- Track my long-term growth as a developer

This repo is not just storage, it's a personal learning journal for code.
